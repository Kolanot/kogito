# Kogito - Coffee Shop 

This repository showcases some of the key capabilities of Kogito specifically on how it:

1. Provides runtime persistence for workflows to preserve the state of the process instances across restarts
2. Supports first class citizen support for events and enables integration with third party systems with both events and external REST API calls
3. Enables the tracking of the process instances progress from the Kogito process management console
4. Integrates with an OpenId Connect Server to provide security to the the Kogito application endpoints 

## Pre-requisites

To start with, ensure that the following are installed in your machine.

-   [OpenJDK 8+](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-java-11-openjdk-11-on-rhel-8)
-   [Visual Studio Code 1.41.1](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
-   [Kogito Visual Studio Code extension (latest)](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases)
-   [Red Hat Java VSCode extension (latest)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java)

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
-   [Docker Engine (atleast 1.13) and Docker Compose (atleast 1.25)](https://download.docker.com/)

## Installing Kogito tooling on Visual Studio Code

1. Download the latest Visual Studio plugin from the project page: https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-tooling/releases
2. Select the latest version
3. From the 'Assets' section, download the file `vscode_extension_kogito_kie_editors_n.n.n.vsix`
4. Open Visual Studio Code
  a. Select the Extensions pane on the left
  b. Click the... icon on the top right
  c. Select Install from VSIX...
5. Exit VSCode 

## Importing & opening the projects into Visual Studio Code

 1. Open Visual Studio Code 
 2. Go to "File", "Add Folder to Workspace"
 3. Select the folder `coffee-shop` in your file system 
 4. Click "Add" 
 5. Repeat the same steps for the `barista` project as well. 
 
Alternatively, the following commands could be run on a terminal: `code <<project-name>>` where project names are `apps/coffee-shop` and `apps/barista` to open both these projects in VSCode.

## Start the required containers

All the relevant containers that are required to run these applications `coffee-shop` and `barista` are contained in `config/all-in-one-docker-compose.yaml` and these containers could be started by using docker-compose.

`$ cd config && docker-compose -f all-in-one-docker-compose.yaml up -d`

This will start up 6 containers namely - Kafka, ZooKeeper, Infinispan, Keycloak, Kogito Data Index Engine and Kogito Management Console. 

## Coffee-shop project - A quick overview

The drink-order-process (_located at `coffee-shop/src/main/resource/org/bala/drink/process`_) depicts the typical drink ordering steps at a coffee shop where a customer would walk in, place an order at the counter desk and then make payment at the payment desk either by cash or by a credit card. If the payment type is credit card, the payment processing would be handled by an external payment gateway. Once the payment processing goes through successfully, the barista would be notified to get started with the preparation of the required coffee. 

## Barista project - A quick overview

The barista process has been designed to run as a seperate Kogito application and would be reacting to the coffee drink order taking process. Again, it is a very simple one that shows that the barista would prepare the coffee and the customer would collect it once it is ready.

## Process persistence

Kogito provides process persistence through Infinispan, which is an in-memory data grid. Process persistence can be enabled in Kogito by adding the extensions `quarkus-infinispan-client` and `infinispan-persistence-addon` to the Kogito project. The dependencies that are required for adding  these extensions are:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-infinispan-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.kie.kogito</groupId>
      <artifactId>infinispan-persistence-addon</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    
The connection configurations using which the Kogito application needs to connect to a Infinispan data-grid has to be specified in the application.properties as follows. 

    quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=localhost:11222
    quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-server-name=infinispan
    quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-username=infinispan
    quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-password=infinispan
    quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-realm=default
    quarkus.infinispan-client.client-intelligence=BASIC

### Data Containers for processes

The Infinispan management console can be accessed at `https://localhost:11222` with the credentials `infinispan\infinispan`

The infinispan console would display the list of all available data stores. Only three data containers will be listed in the console - jobs, processinstances and usertaskinstances that were created by kogito data index service and jobs service. There will not be any other process specific persistent stores available in the data grid at this moment. 

### Running the applications

In order to see process persistence in action, execute the commands listed below in two different terminals to start the applications `coffee-shop` and `barista` 

**Terminal 1:**
`$cd apps/coffee-shop && mvn clean compile quarkus:dev`

**Terminal 2:** 
`$cd apps/barista && mvn clean compile quarkus:dev`

Now, go back to the Infinispan management console and you'll see that the the application specific backing stores (`drink_order_process_store` and `barista_process_store`) would have got created on the fly in the data-grid. 

## Open API and Swagger UI

Once the applications have been started, the process specific REST APIs would get generated automatically and Swagger UI could be used to invoke these APIs and interact with the applications. In order to add the open API & swagger capabilities to a Kogito application, the following dependency has been added to the pom.xml of the application.

    <dependency>
	    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
	    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-openapi</artifactId>
	</dependency>

The Swagger UI for the coffee-shop application can be accessed at `http:localhost:8080/swagger-ui`. From the Swagger UI, the drink order process can be started by invoking the end point `POST
/drink_order_process`. Alternatively, the process instance could be started from the terminal using the command

`# start process instance
curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:8080/drink_order_process" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{}"`

_**Note**: Note down the process instance id that's comes back as a part of the response to this API call. The following sections will refer to this id as {puid}_

After starting the process instances, the status/progress of the process instance could be tracked from the process management console that is available at `http://localhost:8380/`. 

![Kogito Management Console](config/1.png?raw=true "Title")

In the process management console, select the `Drink Order Process` instance and you can see that the process instance would be waiting at the `place-order` step. Since the persistence has been enabled, even if the `coffee-shop` kogito application goes down, the process instance would remain intact in its current state. You may try to terminate the `coffee-shop` application (_by pressing ctrl+c in the terminal in which it was started_) and you would see that process instance would still remaining in its current state in the Kogito management console. (_if you terminate the application, remember to start it back with the command `cd apps/coffee-shop && mvn compile quarkus:dev`)

Complete the place order by using the step specific REST APIs. First, get the task instance id for the process instance {puid} and by invoking the API

` # get all tasks for a process instance
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8080/drink_order_process/{puid}/tasks" -H "accept: application/json" `

Then complete the `place-order` task by invoking the step spcific API along with the order details. 

`# submit the place-order task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/drink_order_process/{puid}/place_order/{tuid}" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"order_out\":{\"cupSize\":\"SMALL\",\"drinkType\":\"MOCHA\"}}"`

Now that the 
# get all tasks for a process instance
curl -i -X GET "http://localhost:8080/drink_order_process/{puid}/tasks" -H "accept: application/json"

# submit the make_payment task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/drink_order_process/{puid}/make_payment/{tuid}" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"order_out\":{\"cardPayment\":{\"cardNumber\":\"6432648726424467\",\"expDate\":\"11-2024\",\"nameOnCard\":\"John Dow\"},\"cupSize\":\"SMALL\",\"drinkType\":\"MOCHA\",\"orderPrice\":15}}"
`

The place order step is complete now and before we complete the make payment step, let's take a look at how the payment processing happens. Once the payment details are specified in the make payment step, and if the payment method is specified as a credit card, the payment processing automated step would get triggered which in turn is configured to invoke a payment gateway API. Let's have a quick look at the process payment step and we can see that the service that's linked to this step is Payments Service and payment processing service operation will be invoked in the payments service. 

Looking at the implementation of the payment service, we don't see much of business logic in here except for the invocation of the external payment gateway API. The external API invocation has been made simple with the help of a Rest Client extension. The extension can be directly added in the pom.xml as can be seen here. With that in place, an interface for the rest client just needs to be registered with the relevant HTTP path and method details. The actual endpoint url of the payment gateway has been externalized and added to the application configuration properties file. With that, let me continue the execution of the process instance by completing the make payment step with the credit card details and we will see that the payment gateway API will be invoked and the barista would be notified of the order. 

From the management console we can see that the barista process has started. Now, how this happened. This was made possible using the native reactive messaging support provided by Kogito. Going back to the process model, we can see that the step Inform barista has been modeled to message event end that has been configured to send order details to the specified barista-process topic in a stream processing engine like Kafka. And all of this has been done without any coding and with just a few configurations. In the application config file, the destination topic to which the message has to be published needs to be specified along with the connection details, and the Kogito event publisher would take care of publishing the event to the specified topic. Again all of this is done without any coding but just with few configurations and by enabling the kogito reactive messaging add ons in the pom.xml

On the receiving side, the barista process has been configured to listen to the same topic and the KOgito event receiver would then receive the event and start the barista process. And this is how we have got the new instance of the barista process created automatically when the drink order process published an event.

Besides that, the Kogito applications can be configured to publish process and user task events at various stages of the process execution, so that any other external systems that need to react to the process instance execution can do so by listening to those events that are emitted at various stages of process execution. For instance, the inbuilt  kogito-processinstances-events and userevents publishing has been enabled in this application. Let's connect to these configured topics using a kafka client and see what events have been published. 

This is a process instance event and taking a look at it, we can see that this event shows the complete process execution history.

So far, we have been interacting with the Kogito application and the process instances using the unsecured REST APIs. Now, let's see how these APIs can be quickly secured with the help of an Open ID connect using Keycloak. Again, securing the APIs is just a matter of configuration and here we are speciying the OIDC server connection details and which path are to be secured and with that, 

we will just save this and do a hot reload by invoking the swagger-ui, we'll see that the swagger-ui is inaccessible now. The client in the OIDC server has been configured with the client credentials flow, the bearer token can be first obtained and the API can be invoked. So, let's first get the access token using the client credentials and store it in an env variable. Now we will use this token to start a process instance and we can see that the process instance has been created.

With that we have come to the end of it. Hope you enjoyed this video and thanks for watching..
